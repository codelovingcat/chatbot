# Chatbot AI Platform

## Project Overview
This project is an intelligent AI-powered chatbot platform designed to interact with users upon login. The chatbot will ask users specific questions to determine their needs and preferences. Based on the gathered data, the system will be able to assign a suitable mentor or direct the user to an appropriate course or other services.

The chatbot platform will be developed with a Python backend to handle AI logic, user management, and data processing. The frontend will be built with React, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface for interaction.

## Key Features
- User authentication and login.
- Dynamic question flow to assess user needs.
- AI-powered analytics to determine user requirements intelligently.
- Mentor assignment based on user needs and preferences.
- Redirection to suitable courses or services.
- Seamless integration of frontend React interface with Python backend.

## Technology Stack
- Backend: Python (with AI/ML integration)
- Frontend: React.js
- Communication: RESTful API or WebSocket for frontend-backend interaction
- AI Components: Natural Language Processing, intelligent decision-making algorithms
